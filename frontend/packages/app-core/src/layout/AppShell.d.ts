/**
 * App Shell Layout
 *
 * Discord-like layout:
 * [ServerRail 72px fixed] | [PanelGroup: Sidebar | Main | Members?]
 *
 * Key fixes vs previous version:
 * - panelRef → ref (react-resizable-panels v0/v1 correct API)
 * - PanelGroup: direction="horizontal" not orientation="horizontal"
 * - wrapper div gets min-w-0 w-full so Outlet never pushes panel wider
 * - resize() called AFTER state update via useEffect to guarantee ref is live
 * - members Panel conditionally mounted — PanelGroup re-evaluates sizes on mount
